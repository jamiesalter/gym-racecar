# gym-racecar
Modified version of the top down car racing environment from the Open AI Gym  
https://github.com/openai/gym

## Installation
Install using the `environment.yml` file with Conda.  This works on Windows.  
```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate racecar
```
Alternatively, install the modules within `environment.yml` manually.

Then run the script `env/car_racing.py` to play as a human.
